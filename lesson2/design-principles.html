                    <p>The BYU Pathways homepage has good visual hierarchy because the biggest thing on the page that draws your eyes is the graduation picture in the background. Then you have the "Online. Low Cost. Spiritual." Then we have the learn more button for if your curiosity is peaked. We then have the Support button on the bottom right, if you need it. There is the BYU Pathway WorldWide logo with the Apply for Free button and the menu button on the side of the logo.</p>

                    <p>This Website uses White Space and Clean Design by having the ribbon at the top and the images below it spaced in such a way that There is plenty of room around the images, the images at the top, and the text.</p>

                    <p>This page makes good use of Rule of Thirds by having the ribbon and the images spaced in such a way that if you visualize the lines the menu ribbon would fall on the top two points and the text of the first image falls on the bottom two points.</p>
